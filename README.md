# Sell-Steam-Items
This is a script i made when i was bored and was tired of all the items i had in my steam inventory. There are still plenty of things to add aswell as fix, however this is a base python file that i was able to code and i find a bit usable.
If someone ends up actually using this, depending on how your computer handles it you might need to change the delay between code.
