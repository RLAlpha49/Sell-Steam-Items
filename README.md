# Sell-Steam-Items
This is a script i made when i was bored and was tired of all the items i had in my steam inventory. There are still plenty of things to add aswell as fix, however this is a base python file that i was able to code and i find a bit usable.



Currently this only works with 2560 x 1440 resolution monitors. If anybody ends up using this you might need to individually change the timings between code, depending on how your computer handles it (should be fine).
